Make InnoDB access all your cores
Increase innodb_buffer_pool_size to 12G
Increase innodb_buffer_pool_instances to 2 (First run numactl --hardware to determine the number of Physical CPUs. What every number of CPUs it reports, use that number. I learned this recently in Jeremy Cole's Blog)
Increase Log File Size (innodb_log_file_size) to 2047M
support separate tablespace files for individual InnoDB tables (enaled innodb_file_per_table)
support either high performance or high durability (ACID Compliance)
High Performance : innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 0 or 2
High Durability : innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 1 (Default)
Increase Size up the innodb_log_buffer_size in conjunction with the number of transactions per second (perhaps 32M)
Your current setting for innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit is good
Your current setting for innodb_flush_method is good
Increase innodb_read_io_threads to 64
Increase innodb_write_io_threads to 64
Increase innodb_io_capactity to 10000

** Partition Size Information **
For partitioned tables, you can query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS table to get the size of each partition.
SELECT 
    table_name AS 'Table',
    partition_name AS 'Partition',
    ROUND(data_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Partition Data Size (MB)',
    ROUND(index_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Partition Index Size (MB)',
    ROUND((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Total Partition Size (MB)'
FROM 
    information_schema.partitions
WHERE 
    table_schema = 'your_database_name' AND 
    table_name = 'your_table_name';

** All Table and Index Sizes in a Database ** 
If you want to see the size of all tables in a database, you can run the following query
SELECT 
    table_name AS 'Table',
    ROUND((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Total Size (MB)',
    ROUND(data_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Data Size (MB)',
    ROUND(index_length / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Index Size (MB)'
FROM 
    information_schema.tables
WHERE 
    table_schema = 'your_database_name'
ORDER BY 
    (data_length + index_length) DESC;
