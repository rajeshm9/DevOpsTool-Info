Make InnoDB access all your cores
Increase innodb_buffer_pool_size to 12G
Increase innodb_buffer_pool_instances to 2 (First run numactl --hardware to determine the number of Physical CPUs. What every number of CPUs it reports, use that number. I learned this recently in Jeremy Cole's Blog)
Increase Log File Size (innodb_log_file_size) to 2047M
support separate tablespace files for individual InnoDB tables (enaled innodb_file_per_table)
support either high performance or high durability (ACID Compliance)
High Performance : innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 0 or 2
High Durability : innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit set to 1 (Default)
Increase Size up the innodb_log_buffer_size in conjunction with the number of transactions per second (perhaps 32M)
Your current setting for innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit is good
Your current setting for innodb_flush_method is good
Increase innodb_read_io_threads to 64
Increase innodb_write_io_threads to 64
Increase innodb_io_capactity to 10000
